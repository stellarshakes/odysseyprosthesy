            <p>
           		My reputation is of savage air<br/>
 				<br/>
				It rolled through a thousand waves<br/>
				filtered past its cage<br/>
				and you hear it wail as it comes<br/>
				<br/>
				My reputation is of asphalt rain<br/>
				<br/>
				Its company is the rain-sky<br/>
				and it stings like a blood fever<br/>
				when it bolts down to greet you<br/>
				<br/>
				My reputation is of dormant gold<br/>
				<br/>
				It was forged in a storm<br/>
				where glory comes from<br/>
				and buys your flesh by the pound<br/>
				<br/>
				As for me<br/>
				<br/>
				I am not make-believe<br/>
				I am made of blood and ideas<br/>
				I make infinite decisions<br/>
				<br/>
				and I'm coming home<br/>
				<br/>
				with the tang of bronze in my eyes<br/>
				and a vacant prison in my hands
            </p>
