            <p>
                Twenty years ago<br/>
                a little bird visited<br/>
                twittering<br/>
                <br/>
                It told me<br/>
                that all his men will be killed<br/>
                that he will return in the twentieth year<br/>
                that he will be unrecognisable<br/>
                <br/>
                I told him<br/>
                and he thought<br/>
                and he thanked me<br/>
                and he thought<br/>
                <br/>
                He told his men<br/>
                but they laughed<br/>
                but they sailed to war<br/>
                but they sailed to war all the same<br/>
                <br/>
                The men have long since stopped laughing<br/>
                <blockquote>sailing now only through Poseidon's black sands</blockquote>
                He continues to think<br/>
                <blockquote>cunning, machinating his way ever homewards</blockquote>
                I pass my time in the yard and at the shore<br/>
                <blockquote>waste my breath in the assembled council</blockquote>
                <br/>
                Today<br/>
                two little birds visited<br/>
                screaming bloody vindications
